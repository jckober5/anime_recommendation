# Divide Music
Over the past years I have became a huge fan of the artist Divide Music and the music he releases. Some of my favorite songs include Drag Me Under, Stand Tall, and By My Side. I love how he incorporates the feeling and emotion from the movie/show into his song that he backdrops to his created music video on Youtube. I know his channel has been growing over the last years but I wanted to do this project to find out just how much it has been growing.

In this project we aim to answer the following questionsâ€¦

What is the average number of views and likes to expect per video?

What are the top songs based on number of likes?

How many likes can you expect on your next video based on the number of views?

Does the Life of the Channel have a significant effect on the number of views or likes they can expect per day?

To collect and clean the data I utilize Python and the Google API to pull data for the Divide Music channel and each one of their videos. After that I store this data within MYSQL for easy access to visual and statistical software. I then create a view by joining the Channel data to the Video data and create additional fields for help in analysis.

Visualizing this data is done utilizing R on this website and on Tableau. In these visualizations we try to answer the questions mentioned above by performing Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive analysis. This way we can describe what has happened, why it happened, what might happen in the future, and what possible courses they should take.
