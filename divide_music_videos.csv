Lyrics-

I had, nothing left to give, but
I won‚Äôt, live on to forgive, 
Im reaching down, down, down, down


You should have left me at the bottom of a noose,
Cause I am counting every second till I get to you,
I‚Äôve broken every bone inside, and no that‚Äôs no excuse,
No I won‚Äôt back down, back down,

Broke ties with my old habit,
Number 1, no two can have it,
Nothing in this world could take it,
Made a true vow, true vow,

Getting caught in pointless places,
Always saw the blur of faces,
Then I found my true base is,
Never without, with-

But

You should have left me at the bottom of a noose,
Cause I am counting every second till I get to you,
I‚Äôve broken every bone inside, and no that‚Äôs no excuse,
No I won‚Äôt back down, back down,

I‚Äôve met the end so many times before,
Came back and always wanting so much more,
My tribe is all I have, my raft to shore, 
My life is mine but know its also yours,

Character Bio -

Roronoa Zoro,[20] also known as ""Pirate Hunter"" Zoro,[9] is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy.[21][22] Formerly a bounty hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[2]

Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the ""Monster Trio"".[23][24] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.[25]

In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the eleven ""Super Rookies"", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War.[26] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the ""Worst Generation.""[27]

Zoro gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc.[17] Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,111,000,000.[4][16]

Obito Uchiha („ÅÜ„Å°„ÅØ„Ç™„Éì„Éà, Uchiha Obito) was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. He was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he gave to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi („Éà„Éì, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito subtly took control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his machinations, eventually going public and starting the Fourth Shinobi World War. However, towards the war's conclusion, Obito had a change of heart and, as atonement, sacrificed his life to save the same world he sought to replace.",14429,777431,720,PT4M35S,275,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Character Bio -

Kakashi Hatake („ÅØ„Åü„Åë„Ç´„Ç´„Ç∑, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan (ÂÜôËº™Áúº„ÅÆ„Ç´„Ç´„Ç∑, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (ÂÖ≠‰ª£ÁõÆÁÅ´ÂΩ±, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).",9590,324200,375,PT3M45S,225,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Naruto Uzumaki („ÅÜ„Åö„Åæ„Åç„Éä„É´„Éà, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinch≈´riki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth ‚Äî a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (Êú®„ÉéËëâÈö†„Çå„ÅÆËã±ÈõÑ, Konohagakure no Eiy≈´, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (‰∏É‰ª£ÁõÆÁÅ´ÂΩ±, Nanadaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).",13932,695010,668,PT3M36S,216,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

-LYRICS - ""The Grand Line""

I‚Äôve been dreaming for far too long
Throwing time right out the window
Above the depths where the wind is strong
Look through my eyes and you‚Äôll see, my
Home‚Äôs on the waters open
I‚Äôm searching for others to, Stand, by  
Me when my guard is broken

Off we row, Off we row
Through any weather
Navigate storms
Till we find the treasure
Off we row, Off we row
Never say never,
We will soon find
Our course, to the
Grand Line 
The Grand Line

See I made a promise that I hold above my head
Every single scar that Ive endured has pulled the thread
The blood I‚Äôve shed
Im far from dead
Ain‚Äôt killed me yet
I‚Äôll never settle for anything less

Don‚Äôt take one more step
I don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre trying to impress
You don‚Äôt know me yet
But I promise you‚Äôll never forget

Off we row, Off we row
Through any weather
Navigate storms
Till we find the treasure
Off we row, Off we row
Never say never,
We will soon find
Our course, to the
Grand Line 
The Grand Line

Madara Uchiha („ÅÜ„Å°„ÅØ„Éû„ÉÄ„É©, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of beginning an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote it and went into hiding to work on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.",23180,1535892,908,PT3M29S,209,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Guts, renowned as the ""Black Swordsman"", is a former mercenary and branded wanderer who travels the world in a constant internal struggle between pursuing his own ends and upholding his attachments to those dear to him.

At one time driven solely by his will to survive, Guts finds purpose in life upon joining the Band of the Falcon, greatly helping in the faction's storied successes during the Hundred-Year War as captain of the band's raiders. He eventually becomes dissatisfied with clinging to Griffith's dream and departs from the band in pursuit of his own. Following the horrors of the Eclipse prompted by Griffith, Guts embarks on a two-year war against the God Hand and apostles, becoming increasingly embittered on his one-track quest for retribution. He in time realizes protecting his regressed lover is more important to him, as well as something he cannot do alone, and thus puts aside his quest for revenge while fostering camaraderie with new companions.

Lyrics - 

I hear the rain,
Start to fall,
As it turns to a pour.

We‚Äôre here again,
In this storm,
But we‚Äôve been here before.

I see the street signs, warning,
Telling me that I have no other place I can go.

Feel like I‚Äôm stuck in motion,
Cant find balance, I‚Äôm living in a vertigo.

Everything is nothing like before,
I‚Äôve tried to hold it together.
Clinging onto memories I swore.
That I could hang on forever. 
But the end, Of the road,
Wasn‚Äôt far ahead, I let go,
And I suddenly woke in my bed.
Rubbed the haze from my eyes.
I‚Äôve always hated goodbyes

Sabotaging what could be something
Better than what came before.

Why do I feel the need to worry,
About what‚Äôs waiting behind the door?

What gives the feeling that It,
Can‚Äôt get better?
I wonder what it thinks of me now?

I want to break out, From the,
Constant battle of proving who I am to a crowd. 

Everything is nothing like before,
I‚Äôve tried to hold it together.
Clinging onto memories I swore.
That I could hang on forever. 
But the end,
Of the road,
Wasn‚Äôt far ahead,
I let go,
And I suddenly woke in my bed.
Rubbed the haze from my eyes.
I‚Äôve always hated goodbyes

One step, closer,
Feel the tide pulling me under.
No four leaf clover,
Always feeling outnumbered.

I know this,
might feel right.
But I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm sober.
can‚Äôt trust myself. 

Everything is nothing like before,
I‚Äôve tried to hold it together.
Clinging onto memories I swore.
That I could hang on forever. 
But the end, Of the road,
Wasn‚Äôt far ahead, I let go,
And I suddenly woke in my bed.
Rubbed the haze from my eyes.
I‚Äôve always hated goodbyes",15211,678334,1183,PT3M53S,233,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

""Orochimaru (Â§ßËõá‰∏∏, Orochimaru) is one of Konohagakure's legendary Sannin. With a life-ambition to learn all of the world's secrets, Orochimaru seeks immortality so that he might live all of the lives necessary to accomplish his task. After being caught red-handed performing unethical experiments on his fellow citizens for the sake of this immortality, Orochimaru defected from Konoha rather than be persecuted for his ambitions, and for many years sought the village's destruction in order to take revenge and demonstrate what he had learned. After several apparent deaths in the pursuit of his goals, Orochimaru realises his approach is flawed through Kabuto Yakushi, his former associate, and begins monitoring the choices and actions of his former apprentice, Sasuke Uchiha.""",15282,1051560,814,PT4M23S,263,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Jiraiya (Ëá™Êù•‰πü) was one of Konohagakure's Sannin. Famed as a hermit and pervert of stupendous ninja skill, Jiraiya travelled the world in search of knowledge that would help his friends, the various novels he wrote, and, posthumously, the world in its entirety ‚Äì knowledge that would be passed on to his godson and final student, Naruto Uzumaki.

Naruto Uzumaki („ÅÜ„Åö„Åæ„Åç„Éä„É´„Éà, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinch≈´riki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth ‚Äî a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (Êú®„ÉéËëâÈö†„Çå„ÅÆËã±ÈõÑ, Konohagakure no Eiy≈´, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (‰∏É‰ª£ÁõÆÁÅ´ÂΩ±, Nanadaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).",30660,2286751,1537,PT3M32S,212,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Saitama („Çµ„Ç§„Çø„Éû, Saitama) is the main protagonist of the series and the titular One-Punch Man and the most powerful being to exist in the series. Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from battle.[3]

Initially just a hero for fun,[4] Saitama later registers to be a professional hero for the Hero Association[5] and defends his home in Z-City from monsters, villains, and other threats.[6] Under the Hero Association, he is assigned the hero name Caped Baldy („Éè„Ç≤„Éû„É≥„Éà, Hagemanto; Viz: Bald Cape)[7] and is currently ranked 7 in the B-Class.[8]",15488,875184,781,PT3M27S,207,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Ichigo Kurosaki is the main protagonist of the manga/anime series Bleach. He is a teenager with the ability to see spirits who gains the powers of a Shinigami from Rukia Kuchiki. He is a hybrid of Human, Soul, Quincy, and Hollow.

Bleach (Japanese: „Éñ„É™„Éº„ÉÅ, Hepburn: Burƒ´chi) is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's manga of the same name.
The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper (Ê≠ªÁ•û, Shinigami, literally, ""Death God"") ‚Äî a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper ‚Äî from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. The anime adaptation includes original storylines not found in the manga with repeated appearances and stories containing these original characters.",16352,982091,725,PT3M58S,238,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Yuji Itadori is a genius at track and field. But he has zero interest running around in circles, he's happy as a clam in the Occult Research Club. Although he's only in the club for kicks, things get serious when a real spirit shows up at school!
When his grandfather is on his deathbed, Yuji makes a promise to him; that he will do kind deeds so that he dies surrounded by loved ones, unlike his grandfather.
However, Yuji's life takes a sudden turn as he meets Megumi Fushiguro; a shaman who tries to retrieve a cursed object. When Yuji's friends open the cursed object that they found, things go south as the cursed spirits that it spawned start roaming in school. As Fushiguro and Yuji are almost defeated by one of the spirits, Yuji then swallows the cursed object and gains its power. As a result, Yuji becomes cursed by the object and gets dragged into Fushiguro's thrilling world of shamans and cursed spirits.",2820,31797,289,PT5M41S,341,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Life has never been better: with gourmet food; plush beds; clean clothes; games; and the love from their ""Mom"", the caretaker, Isabella. The bright and cheerful Emma always aces the regular exams with her two best friends, Ray and Norman. The orphans are allowed complete freedom, except to venture beyond the grounds or the gate, which connects the house to the outside world.

One night, an orphan named Conny is sent away to be ""adopted"", but Emma and Norman follow her after noticing that she left her stuffed toy, Little Bunny, back at the house. At the gate, they find Conny, and they realize the truth of their existence in this idyllic orphanage‚Äîto be raised, and sold as meat to a species known as demons. Determined to break out of Grace Field House, Emma and Norman join with Ray to find a way to escape along with their other siblings before they get shipped off to be eaten.",11408,489978,714,PT4M38S,278,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Sasuke Uchiha („ÅÜ„Å°„ÅØ„Çµ„Çπ„Ç±, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the ""Supporting Kage"" (ÊîØ„ÅÜÂΩ±, Sasaukage, literally meaning: Supporting Shadow).",18747,1232136,973,PT4M16S,256,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, remaining a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.",16820,1130342,622,PT3M59S,239,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

*LYRICS*

I remember when I use to think,
I don‚Äôt have the spirit,
In that moment where my heart would sink
That‚Äôs when I would hear it.

Nothing in this world can tell me no,
breaking down the walls I built my own.
All the insecurities I have sewn,
Stitched into my very bones. 

Im taking the right time,
To figure out what‚Äôs mine,
To make it my own.  

I feel alive,
Im here to fight,
No time to die,
Pushing my body,
Day or night,
I‚Äôll do what‚Äôs right
No time to die,
cant break my body
Im taking the right time,
To figure out what‚Äôs mine,
To make it my own.  cant break my body

And I know, and I hope that,
Everyone knows that,
I can stand all on my own,
But I know that the people,
That surround me,
Push me to better to than I thought I could be.
No longer focus on what I lack,
Even if my body starts to crack,
Its the life I chose, no going back,

Eijiro is a boisterous and outgoing guy with a fondness for the concept of manliness, often using the terms ""manly"" and ""unmanly"" to describe things and people he does or doesn't like. Those who showcase a noble, brave, and/or determined attitude tend to emotionally move him to tears, quickly earning his complete admiration, respect, and friendship. Similarly, he will call out traits that are the opposite of that, such as cowardice and dirty play. He is also a big fan of Crimson Riot, a retro hero that he takes inspiration from, including personal values and his own hero name. Kirishima thinks of Bakugou as ""manly"", which is the biggest sign of respect from him. Kirishima is often shown trying to befriend Bakugou and inviting him to class outings. Bakugou respects Kirishima and calls him by his name. Kirishima is the one Bakugou sees as an equal and, according to Midoriya, the only one who could save him without his pride being hurt.",40930,3880956,1332,PT4M12S,252,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

LYRICS

I feel a pressure,
writing the ledger,
So many people,
Causing damage for their pleasure,
   
Just so appalling,
Tired of stalling,
My hand will,
Ink to the page
Cause death is calling

I see their eyes,
As I walk by,
No one knows but,
i know,
the balance of worlds not right.

say another prayer,
Hope it does you right,
I‚Äôll fill another page
tonight will be the night,
But that won‚Äôt save you from the light.
Nobody to fear,
Nothing left to trace,
Even if you try,
I won‚Äôt be erased.
Nothing will eclipse the light.

No more excuses,
You are so clueless,
You think that you can find me,
But its useless.
The world is thanking me,
Whispers quietly,
I am the answer

Every single I name write,
Has made their choice,
and every innocent I save, 
Still has a voice,
can you say the same for you?
cause I can see right through.
bit more than you can chew

I can feel it in my bones

Death Note (Japanese: „Éá„Çπ„Éé„Éº„Éà, Hepburn: Desu N≈çto) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. Before Minoru TanakaThe story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who stumbles across a mysterious otherworldly notebook: the ""Death Note"", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a world-wide massacre of individuals whom he deems morally unworthy of life to change the world into a utopian society without crime, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named ""Kira"" (""„Ç≠„É©"", the Japanese transliteration of the English word: killer) and the subsequent efforts of an elite task-force of law enforcement officers, consisting of members of the Japanese police force, led by L, an enigmatic international detective whose past is shrouded in mystery, to apprehend him and end his reign of terror. In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student named Light Yagami finds the ""Death Note"", a mysterious black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. After verifying that the notebook works and initially being terrified of its god-like abilities, Light begins to consider the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and sets out to create a utopian world without crime, killing numerous high-profile Japanese criminals, before eventually targeting international criminals and felons around the world. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a ""Shinigami,"" beings inspired by the Japanese god of death and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, who is invisible to anyone who has not touched the Death Note, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions

Light Yagami (Â§úÁ•ûÊúà, Yagami Raito) is the main protagonist of the Death Note series. After discovering the Death Note, he decides to use it to rid the world of criminals. His killings are eventually labelled by people of Japan as the work of ""Kira."" Light is characterized as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. Highly perceptive and good with problem solving, Light was a skilled planner and good at mapping out scenarios. Furthermore, Light was very popular among peers and adored by his family members. However, his high intelligence and constant praise from adults laid the foundation for an intense level of hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the notebook.

Ryuk („É™„É•„Éº„ÇØ, Ry≈´ku) is a Shinigami who indirectly gives Light Yagami a Death Note after becoming bored with the Shinigami Realm. In an effort to amuse himself, he steals a second Death Note and drops it into the Human World for someone to find. This Death Note is discovered by Light, who uses it in an attempt to cleanse the world of evil and injustice, satisfying Ryuk's need for entertainment.

L („Ç®„É´, Eru) is a world-renowned detective who takes on the challenge of catching the mass murderer known as Kira. In his investigation, L becomes suspicious of Light Yagami and makes it his goal to prove that Light is Kira.",10521,661996,468,PT4M7S,247,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Hear the sound of songbirds sing. 
In the forest, Where I am king. 
But I can‚Äôt go back,
They all think of me as a failure. 
couldn‚Äôt extinguish the flames

But I found, the one, Who took my heart, Held it.
Made me believe, The world is not Hellbent. 
She is, The one, That I believe, That could save me. 

I may not, be able, to pick, up all the pieces,
but I can surely try.
This kingdom, will gain its freedom, when the sins can,
expose their countless lies.

get up x3
I gotta make this right
get up x3
expose their countless lies.

Though Ive tried to forget, 
it is so hard to let go,
and I know who was responsible. 

I don‚Äôt care, What you say,
Knowing what happened that day,
You took her life,Away from me,
she was my only family.

Why did you have to take her?

LYRICS

In the shadows I‚Äôve grown,
In my struggles ive shown,
I‚Äôll never back down for anyone,
You Think this is the end ive just begun

Through my life,
ive been gentle
But I know,
Its in my mental,
 
Stop,
Need a moment,
a component,
i try to show it,
so soft spoken,
Am I broken?
No, who‚Äôs my next opponent?

Every moment
pushes me to,
Focus harder,
show I can do,
Anything I,
set my mind to
no obstacle 
I can‚Äôt push through

I‚Äôve seen eternity bottled into a moment
Markings drawn are the treaty I‚Äôm gonna hold it
Why‚Äôd it take me so damn long (so long, so long, so long too‚Ä¶)
Fit myself for improvement, they always noticed
Hy≈´ga blood a shinobi i‚Äôll be the coldest.¬†¬†¬†
How‚Äôd this feeling get so strong (so strong, so strong, so strong I‚Ä¶)
Yea I‚Äôm gonna be
Over the edge
Burning to see
What I got left
Pushing till I‚Äôm gone, pray 
down to give it all, they tell me that

Neji Hy≈´ga (Êó•Âêë„Éç„Ç∏, Hy≈´ga Neji) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hy≈´ga clan. Though a prodigy even by the Hy≈´ga's standards, Neji was a member of the clan's branch house; no matter how skilled he became, he would always be in service to the Hy≈´ga's main house, a fact that convinced him fate was predetermined. After experiencing Naruto Uzumaki's refusal to be limited by such an ideology, Neji realised his fate was what he chose it to be, and as a member of Team Guy he sought the strength necessary to make the future he wanted for his family and friends, and ultimately sacrificed his life to protect the very same person who taught him about the freedom of one's choice of fate, Naruto.

Hinata Uzumaki („ÅÜ„Åö„Åæ„Åç„Éí„Éä„Çø, Uzumaki Hinata, n√©e Hy≈´ga (Êó•Âêë)) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. She lost her position as heiress of the Hy≈´ga clan due to her meek disposition making her unsuited for the responsibilities of leading the clan.

*LYRICS*

Innocent, I didn‚Äôt ask for this. 
But I know the risk. 
If I expose myself. 
Who will help?
I‚Äôm holding on, but losing my grip. 

I don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore. 
The voice inside is hungry for more
I won‚Äôt let myself be pressured to be. 
The evil that the world only sees. 

I won‚Äôt give up. 
There‚Äôs still a light inside. 
No one. 
Will tell me otherwise. I‚Äôm
Hoping, I can prove to find. 
A way that we can open up our minds. 

The media is pushing 
that all of us are just looking
To feed on every innocent
Life. But they don‚Äôt understand. 
That not everybody. 
Wants to disembody. 
Cause I see. 
That the goodness in people isn‚Äôt hard to find.

The story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive. The ghouls who manage the coffee shop ""Anteiku"" take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from his best friend Hideyoshi Nagachika.

Ken Kaneki (ÈáëÊú® Á†î, Kaneki Ken) is the main protagonist of the Tokyo Ghoul series. He is currently Touka Kirishima's husband, and the father of Ichika Kaneki. Previously, he was a student who studied Japanese literature at Kamii University, living a relatively normal life. However, this quickly changed after Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou was transplanted into him and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. Kaneki is the first known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His unique half ghoul state is what later inspires the idea of the Quinx. After joining Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually becomes known as Eyepatch (ÁúºÂ∏Ø, Gantai).",3818,167371,139,PT3M24S,204,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Look at What this world has become
It sickens me to my core, feels so numb. 
They think that they have it under control. 
But they‚Äôre so wrong. 
I‚Äôll Rip the symbol from they‚Äôre ivory tower
Leave no one. 
Watch it burn 

No one, can take this away from me. 
Your bodies will rot beneath my very feet. 
All for one. Is all I‚Äôll ever strive to be. 
Bring down the city to its very knees. 

You think that I‚Äôm a monster,
It‚Äôs a Compliment, I‚Äôll foster,
You have no idea,
When you walk in my Arena
What It will cost ya

If they think that they can do it better than me. 
I‚Äôd Like to see them try. 
When tables turn and I‚Äôm looking down on them
Watching them cry. 
Plead for their lives",9898,682507,382,PT3M1S,181,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

have you ever had a goal in mind?
to set course for the ultimate find,
Im searching,
but the tides keep on turning

And the waves, crash down upon the shore,
as we peak behind closed doors,
Together we are home, are home.

When I was young I found a purpose true,
To be the king of the ocean blue,
I‚Äôm certain,
so determined 

As the wind, is caught inside our sail,
We will soon prevail.
To stop us you will fail

We will never be the last in line,
Me and my crew
Will face the battles
conquer in due time.
above the law, 
We are the straw,
Hats abound,
I will be crowned.
Never will we bow,
To another crew,
we are the fearless pirates,
storming on the ocean blue,
Above the law, 
We are the straw,
Hats abound,
I will be crowned.

loyal,
to my crew,
threaten any one of them,
And you are through
Don‚Äôt expect,
I will let it go.

I‚Äôm Wanted,
Dead or alive,
in the face of dangers
Where I truly strive,
So give it,
Your best shot.    

The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are an infamous and powerful rising pirate crew that originated from the East Blue, but have various members from different areas. They are the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece, and are led by the main protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy. The ""Straw Hats"" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by Red-Haired Shanks, and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in Alabasta.[19] The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg even though the members fought over different names. The Straw Hats currently consist of ten members whose combined bounties equal Beli3,161,000,100.[8][5]",13739,1429772,431,PT6M23S,383,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Soon be,
Asking,
For forgiveness.
I‚Äôll be,

You will be my witness

fuels the flame inside.

To stand side by side.
the only one who told me.
That I could if I tried.
one for all.
I will carry on with pride.
I will carry on with pride.   

Keeping all the focus strong in my mind. 
Any doubts I‚Äôve had gotta leave behind. 
It‚Äôs not a game, no restart, can‚Äôt stop time. 
But you won‚Äôt change my destiny
It‚Äôs all mine. 

You think, you can tell her what to do. 
But I will, prove it isn‚Äôt up to you. 
She will, smile again when this is through. 
All you‚Äôve built will tumble right on cue.

I‚Äôve been searching. 
I‚Äôve been wandering. 
I‚Äôve been finding,
Who‚Äôs reliant. 
Wondering if,
I will ever know. 

Will I ever let it go?
I don‚Äôt know. 
Am I the cause?
I figured so. 
How much time,
Till I can find. 
Peace in my soul. 

This pain,
In my bones,
reminds,
Me how I‚Äôve grown
But i am waiting, I‚Äôm waiting for you
Waiting, I‚Äôm waiting for you. 
Can anybody hear me?

The past is haunting,
Futures daunting,
But even when the,
World is falling. 
I will be there,
Standing by my side.

*LYRICS*

I can see the path before my very eyes 
I am to be the only king. 
This power I have rests inside
Watch me let it go. 

When I was young,
I wasn‚Äôt sure that I could truly be. 
Someone I need to be. 
What sleeps inside of me?

That very night my brother,
Showed what I couldn‚Äôt see. 
What I couldn‚Äôt see. 

I soon began to understand 
My potential, 
Just gotta keep my focus,
That is essential. 
If I aim to be the king,
I can‚Äôt hold back for anything. 
I know, oh I know. I-I-I won‚Äôt. 

Lord I‚Äôm really feeling blessed, 
and I feel like I the best
Seeing the spiritual flex, 
being so powerful what‚Äôs coming next 
Though I‚Äôm a commoner, 
better monitor anything you wanna get off chest
Unless you want to me summon the wind, 
coming to take off your flesh, 
Stick to my grimoire, 
look at my life wanna flip flop, 
No sign up for the squad, 
pissed off cause you don‚Äôt want to see the liftoff
Rise with the Golden Dawn, 
fly with the white hawk, 
run from my light green mana 
Know I‚Äôm the chosen one, 
a magic knight taking out armadas
Sick of the drama, try to mess with my demeanor, 
when you see The four-leaf clovers,
 know you‚Äôre face against a leader",7293,674134,239,PT3M28S,208,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

LYRICS -

-VERSE 1-

Got these demons,
Living in my mind,
Feeding on my faith,
No matter the walls,
They stand behind,
I will deliver their fate 

See the stage being set I‚Äôm soaring higher,
In a rage, No regrets, rain down hellfire. 

We can‚Äôt retreat when all hope seems lost. 
We must deliver the pain. 
One slice behind the neck, that‚Äôs the trick. 
Remember the name. 

-CHORUS- 

We dream, to have peace beyond the walls. 
Across the land as far as the eye can see. 
We, must not give in to fear. 
The end is just out of our reach, but each push. Draws us near. 

-VERSE 2-

A New found power in myself. 
Can it be explained?
Is this a dream I ask of you
am I insane?
 
See the stage being set I‚Äôm soaring higher,
In a rage, No regrets, rain down hellfire. 
i don‚Äôt know if we will live to see the day,
Until that time, we cut their throats, make em pay.",4473,259807,179,PT3M37S,217,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

LYRICS -

I won‚Äôt fall to pieces
Counting up these scars
Things that keep me decent
Never seemed so far
Believe 
In letting go, I was born from sin
Believe
In taking hold, power from within, I‚Äôm
Holding onto to seconds to make em‚Äô turn into minutes
Counting all my blessings I never want him to finish
Climbing all my towers the evil‚Äôs gotta diminish
We‚Äôll never grow apart
I‚Äôm by your side

Believe, i can achieve,
see this fire in my soul will guide me right to you
Believe, i fear nothing,
I‚Äôve come to clip your wings,
ground you down can you hear the angels sing?

Its like, cold hands around my neck,
Not a life that I‚Äôd come to expect,
No rest for the wicked, I‚Äôve come to learn
its not the fire inside that‚Äôs gonna burn oh   
Everybody living day by day,
Not knowing what lies and waits no,
Got my own vengeance on my mind,
Gonna right the wrongs that took place on that day.

Lyrics:

Standing ankle deep in something. 
wondering if I should dive in. 
her voice echoes at me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with you‚Äù
as light around us blackens 

Listen to the words i'm saying
She says that it‚Äôs not even a question. 
i will follow you absolutely. 
Vowing she will always be beside me. 

there‚Äôs something only she has been able,
to bring out of me, keeps me stable,
when she shows her heart its so graceful,
baby know I‚Äôm always so grateful 

she keeps me lost in the moments,
gotta catch my breath,
she puts my doubts to rest.
as she puts her arms around my chest

like cold water,
it hits me to my core,
am i dreaming cause the weight of it all
seems so much lighter,
flame‚Äôs burning brighter.

when she holds, tighter,
my body floats a little higher,
am i dreaming cause the weight of it all
seems so much lighter,
flame‚Äôs burning brighter.",1364,32002,152,PT3M32S,212,Friday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Lyrics:

Holding hands with the devil. 
Taken to a higher level. 
Leaving everything disheveled. 
What have I become? 

On the surface I try to keep it all together. 
Underneath is a demon watching like no other. 
Telling me it‚Äôll keep me safe, if I don‚Äôt strain the tether.
I keep holding on. 

Hear it,
Whisper,
Fissure,
My sanity I,
Fear it,
Will consume my
Life I,
Ask why me I,
Tell myself to
just keep holding on 

Think back into the day,
When I was lost and so afraid,
I‚Äôve turned a darker shade. 
Can I let it go?

Yea,

I think my body is turning
Everything is fading grey
I‚Äôm almost gone are you certain, I‚Äôll be okay?
Taking control becomes the remedy
Screaming victims have become my favorite melody, oh yea

If you side with me, there‚Äôs no doubt
That the crime will be payed, don‚Äôt shout
Taking control becomes the remedy
I‚Äôm symbiotic, lacking empathy, the enemy

Hear it,
Whisper,
Fissure,
My sanity I,
Fear it,
Will consume my
Life I,
Ask why me I,
Tell myself to
just keep holding on 

Think back into the day,
When I was lost and so afraid,
(Never had a home)
I‚Äôve turned a darker shade. 
(Never had a home, can I let it go?)
Can I let it go?
I keep holding on.",3658,222483,113,PT4M21S,261,Saturday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0

Vampyr is an action role-playing video game developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Focus Home Interactive. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in June 2018. The plot relates how Jonathan Reid, a doctor who has turned into a vampire, comes to terms with his undead condition as he is torn between the Hippocratic Oath and his newfound bloodthirsty nature. Although some boss battles are mandatory, most combat can be avoided and the player is under no obligation to finish the game. Dialogue options can be used for hunting prey to feed on, which replenishes strength and levels up the lead character. Weapons and supernatural abilities are employed while combatting enemies. London serves as a fictionalised semi-open world composed of four districts, which can all be destroyed based on the player's actions.",2348,123704,89,PT3M56S,236,Saturday,UC3P-tn_Mk1V_KE8M2On8F2w,0
